    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Current Junior at the College of the Holy Cross. Majoring in Physics and Computer Science. I am a self-taught web-developer, 
        and aspiring Mechanical Engineer with a Robotics/Mechatronics + Biomechanics focus. In terms of CS knowledge, I am competent in 
        backend development using Python and frontend development using JS, HTML, and CSS. I am as well experienced in using C, C++, Java, and R 
        in separate projects. I am currently working on expanding my knowledge and ability in CS for more systematic purposes towards
        robotics.</p>
